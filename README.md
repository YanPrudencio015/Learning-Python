üêç My Python Setup Journey

I started learning Python and here‚Äôs how I set up everything on my computer until I could finally run my first .py file.

üîΩ Installation

I went to the official website: python.org/downloads

Downloaded the latest stable version

While installing on Windows, I made sure to check the option ‚úÖ Add Python to PATH

Followed the setup and waited until the installation was complete

üñ•Ô∏è Checking the Installation

To confirm everything worked, I opened the terminal and ran:

python --version


(or python3 --version depending on the system)

It showed me the installed version (e.g. Python 3.12.0). At that point, I knew Python was ready.

‚úçÔ∏è My First Script

I created a file called hello.py with this content:

print("Hello, World!")

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Script

In the terminal, I navigated to the folder where I saved the file and executed:

python hello.py


(or python3 hello.py)

The terminal displayed:

Hello, World!
